Permissions
These define the access that different users have on the different parts of the system.
example permission can_edit when given to a certain user, it means they can change that specific object be it document or a model.
the permission can_create, gives users permissions to create instances of objects.

Groups
Used as a collection of permissions, where a single group can contain more than one permission.
A single group can be allocated to different users at the same time.
Permissions like can_edit and can_create can be grouped under a single group e.g Writers, and any user added to this group has the ability to both create and edit.
